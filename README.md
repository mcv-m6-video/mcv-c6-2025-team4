## Week 1:

This project focuses on background estimation in video sequences for road traffic monitoring. The goal is to classify background and foreground objects, using statistical models. We implement a Single Gaussian Model for background estimation, including both adaptive and non-adaptive approaches. The results of these models will be compared against more complex, state-of-the-art techniques.

Key Features:

    Single Gaussian Model for background estimation.
    Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Models for background subtraction.
    Comparison with more advanced models for background subtraction and object detection.
